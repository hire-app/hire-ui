# Hire App

It is a web application that displays a collection of user profiles with various features for filtering and searching. It fetches user data from the Random User API and provides an intuitive user interface for interacting with the data.

## Features

### User Filtering

The User Dashboard allows you to filter the displayed user profiles based on their gender. The gender filter buttons, located at the top of the page, enable you to quickly toggle between displaying only male, female, or all users.

### Search by Name

The application includes a search bar where you can enter a name to search for specific users. As you type in the search query, the user profiles will be dynamically filtered to display only those that match the entered name.

### User Profile Display

The user profiles are presented as cards, with each card showing the user's avatar, name, location, email, and phone number. The age of the user is also displayed as a badge on the avatar. The profiles are arranged in a responsive grid layout, adapting to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience.

### Add User

You have the option to add a new user to the dashboard by clicking on the "Add a new user" card. This will open a form where you can enter the details of the new user, such as their name, location, email, and phone number. Once submitted, the new user will be added to the existing list of profiles and displayed on the dashboard.
